## 1️⃣ What is a Variable?

### ✅ Definition:

A **variable** is a name given to a memory location used to store data.

👉 Simple meaning:
A variable is like a **container** that stores some value.

---

### 🧠 Real Life Example

Think of a water bottle.

* Bottle = Variable
* Water inside = Value
* Type of bottle = Data Type

---

### 🖥 Example in C++

```cpp
int age = 20;
```

Here:

* `int` → data type
* `age` → variable name
* `20` → value stored

---

## 2️⃣ Rules for Naming Variables

✔ Can contain letters, digits, underscore
✔ Must start with a letter or underscore
✔ Cannot use keywords (`int`, `return`, etc.)
✔ Case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different)

---

### ✅ Valid Examples

```cpp
int marks;
float total_amount;
int student1;
```

### ❌ Invalid Examples

```cpp
int 1age;      // cannot start with number
int total marks; // space not allowed
int int;       // keyword not allowed
```

---

# 3️⃣ What is a Data Type?

### ✅ Definition:

A **data type** tells the compiler what type of data a variable can store.

👉 It defines:

* Type of value
* Size in memory
* Range of values

---

# 4️⃣ Basic Data Types in C++

---

## 🔹 1. int (Integer)

Stores whole numbers.

```cpp
int age = 25;
int marks = 100;
```

✔ No decimal values
✔ Usually 4 bytes

---

## 🔹 2. float

Stores decimal numbers.

```cpp
float price = 99.5;
```

✔ Single precision
✔ 4 bytes

---

## 🔹 3. double

Stores bigger decimal numbers with more precision.

```cpp
double pi = 3.14159265;
```

✔ More accurate than float
✔ 8 bytes

---

## 🔹 4. char

Stores a single character.

```cpp
char grade = 'A';
```

✔ Written inside single quotes
✔ Stores only one character

---

## 🔹 5. bool

Stores true or false.

```cpp
bool isPassed = true;
```

✔ Only two values: true / false

---

# 5️⃣ Declaration vs Initialization

### 🔹 Declaration

```cpp
int age;
```

Variable created but no value assigned.

---

### 🔹 Initialization

```cpp
int age = 20;
```

Variable created and value assigned.

---

# 6️⃣ Multiple Variable Declaration

```cpp
int a = 10, b = 20, c = 30;
```

---

# 7️⃣ Printing Variables

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int age = 21;
    cout << age;
    return 0;
}
```

---

# 8️⃣ Memory Concept (Important for Understanding)

When we write:

```cpp
int age = 25;
```

👉 Computer:

* Reserves memory
* Stores 25 inside it
* Links that memory to name "age"

You can explain:

> Variable is just a name. Actual value is stored in RAM.

---

# 9️⃣ Example Program for Students

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

    int age = 20;
    float height = 5.8;
    char grade = 'A';
    bool isStudent = true;

    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    cout << "Height: " << height << endl;
    cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
    cout << "Student Status: " << isStudent << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

# 🔟 Common Mistakes Beginners Make

❌ Forgetting semicolon
❌ Using double quotes for char
❌ Using float instead of int
❌ Not initializing variables
❌ Confusing float and double

---

# 🎯 Short Summary (For End of Video)

✔ Variable = container
✔ Data type = type of data stored
✔ C++ is strongly typed
✔ Must declare before using
✔ Data types decide memory size
